# LSTM

In this example, we demonstrate training LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) model with dummy dataset.

### LSTM Model Configuration

This is an example of a simple recurrent neural network model consisting of one LSTM cell.

### Comparision with other frameworks

For the comparison, we provide PyTorch and Tensorflow code for same model in ```pytorch/lstm.py``` and ```tensorflow/lstm.py```, respectively.

You can run pytorch code with

``` bash
$ python3 ./pytorch/torch_lstm.py
```

You can run tensorflow code with

``` bash
$ python3 ./tensorflow/tensor_lstm.py
```
